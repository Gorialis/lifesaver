Lifesaver is an extremely opinionated bot foundation built on top of
`discord.py@rewrite <https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite/>`__.

Please be aware that this library contains lots of opinionated features
and hand-holding, and this isn't really meant to be used by anyone â€” this
repository is open-source just for the sake of being open-source, for curious
eyes.
